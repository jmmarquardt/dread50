# Dread50

This is my submission for Assignment # 9, Dread 50 in Harvard Extension School's E23 Intro to Game Development. Gradescope is not handling submission of large Unity projects as zipped folders very well, so I uploaded to my gh to submit this way. This project is my submitted academic work, and I will delete it after grading.
